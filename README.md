Android application that enables users to use their smartphone's camera to scan a bus stop code/name in Bologna, and receive back the next two buses coming by.
It uses CameraX and ML-Kit to take a picture and recognize the text in it.

It also uses OpenStreetMap to let the user decide the bus stop of interest in the case multiple matches are found (e.g. bus stops one in front of the other oftentimes have the same name).

The application was devoped as project exam for the course "Sistemi Digitali M" at the University of Bologna.
